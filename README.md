# Clock âŒš

![CSS clocks](../card_images/clocks.png)

In this project I practiced CSS a lot, the first clock is based on the challenge 2 of the JAvascript30 challenge. For the second one, I took inspiration from the apple watch face, using SVG for that. Finally, for the third one, I only add the time to a container.
